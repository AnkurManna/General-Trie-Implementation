# General-Trie-Implementation
Trie is an efficient information reTrieval data structure. Using Trie, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit (key length). If we store keys in binary search tree, a well balanced BST will need time proportional to M * log N, where M is maximum string length and N is number of keys in tree. Using Trie, we can search the key in O(M) time. However the penalty is on Trie storage requirements

This repository contains:
1) General Trie implementation using pointers
2) 2D array based implementation
3) Dfs on trie and aggregate function calculation for subtree
4) Maximum Xor pair 
5) Maximum Xor for dynamic stream of integers
